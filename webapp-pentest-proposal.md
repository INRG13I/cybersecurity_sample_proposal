# Sample Web Application Penetration Test Proposal

## 1. Objectives
- Assess the security posture of the target web application.  
- Identify vulnerabilities following the **OWASP Top 10** (SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication issues, etc.).  
- Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and improve resilience.  

---

## 2. Scope
- In-scope: target web application and related endpoints.  
- Out-of-scope: denial-of-service testing, physical security, social engineering.  

---

## 3. Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance** – Identify domains, subdomains, and technology stack.  
2. **Scanning** – Use tools to detect open ports, services, and directories.  
3. **Exploitation** – Test for injection flaws, authentication bypass, and misconfigurations.  
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Evaluate potential data exposure or privilege escalation.  
5. **Reporting** – Document findings with severity ratings and mitigation guidance.  

---

## 4. Tools & Resources
- **Nmap** – port and service scanning  
- **Gobuster / Dirb** – directory enumeration  
- **Burp Suite** – web traffic interception and fuzzing  
- **SQLmap** – SQL injection testing  
- **Nikto** – vulnerability scanning  
- **OWASP ZAP** – automated security testing  

---

## 5. Deliverables
- **Technical Report** – full list of vulnerabilities, CVSS severity scores, and recommended mitigations.  
- **Executive Summary** – non-technical overview for management.  
- **Evidence** – screenshots, logs, or PoC code for each confirmed vulnerability.  

---

## 6. Timeline (example for small app)
- **Day 1**: Reconnaissance and scanning  
- **Day 2–3**: Exploitation and manual testing  
- **Day 4**: Documentation and reporting  

---

## 7. Success Criteria
- All critical and high-severity issues identified and documented.  
- Clear remediation steps provided.  
- Stakeholders receive both technical and business-level insights.
