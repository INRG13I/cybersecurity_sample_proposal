# Cybersecurity Project Proposals

This repository contains a few example proposals I created to practice how cybersecurity projects can be structured.  
The goal is to show how objectives, steps, tools, and expected results can be written down in a clear and organized way.

## 📂 Contents
- **Web Application Penetration Test Proposal** – based on OWASP Top 10, includes steps, tools, and deliverables.  
- **More to come** – I plan to add examples in the future (e.g. network assessments, incident response, compliance).

## 🎯 Objectives
With these proposals I want to:  
- practice documenting a cybersecurity project;  
- show that I can organize steps and deliverables clearly;  
- make use of common tools and methods used in the field;  
- build material for my professional portfolio.
